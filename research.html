<h1>My main research <a name="top"></a> </h1>

<h3>A Multinomial compact-interval restricted Boltzmann machine </h3> 
<p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are undirected probabilistic graphical models that can be interpreted as stochastic neural networks. In their basic formulation, Boltzmann Machines (BM) involve binary variables. They have found applications in a wide range of learning problems. However, RBMs are generally used as a preliminary phase for other algorithms, providing either data preprocessing or an initialization method for feedforward neural network classifiers. They are not typically considered a standalone solution for classification problems. In this paper, we proposed several variants of the RBM in which the observed variables are assumed to be continuous and bounded. We demonstrated that the underlying models could solve high-dimensional data classification problems without relying on another classification algorithm. The experiments showed that, in addition to having good characteristics as generative data models, the proposed models possess excellent predictive power, outperforming certain standard models commonly used for classification tasks.</p>

<p> As you can see, another powerful aspect of the border properties is that they can be altered either as a whole (so that all four edges look the same) or individually. To alter the characteristics individually, you simply add the side specification (top, bottom, right, or left) to the border property, after “border” and before any final characteristic. To give you an idea how this is done, consider the following example and Figure 6-6. Here, I’ve created a class called “headshot” and then set the border properties in my style sheet. </p>

<p> Developing countries face major challenges in education. The educational situation of African populations is particularly worrying. Indeed, the school exclusion rate remains the highest in sub-Saharan African countries. According to UNESCO, Over one-fifth of primary-age children are out of school, and almost 60 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 17 are not in school. In addition, this exclusion rate is generally higher among girls. This observation is due to several reasons. First, the state of household poverty combined with the high costs of education constitute determining factors for the low education rate in Africa. Second, these countries are limited in school infrastructure characterized by overcrowding in classes, which does not motivate students to go to classes. Although some countries have made an effort to provide free primary school fees, there is a lack of monitoring of students, who are sometimes left to their own devices. </p>

<p> My training in statistics has allowed me to acquire strong expertise in statistical analysis and data modeling. I have frequently worked with large-scale data, particularly in the fields of health, education, and linguistics, which has provided me with significant experience in data analysis. Additionally, my research on machine learning models has enabled me to build a solid expertise in this area, as well as proficiency in programming and statistical analysis tools such as SPSS, STATA, Python, R, and others. My experience as a statistics teacher for social sciences, survival analysis, and optometry further enhances my ability to meet expectations in data analysis. Moreover, my various experiences within the Statistical Consulting Service of the Department of Statistics at the University of Montreal, as well as in various research centers, have equipped me with the skills necessary to overcome the challenges of this new post. Creative, dynamic, and discreet, I also appreciate teamwork, where I can contribute my experience and expertise to the group. The dynamism and excellence of your organization would provide me with the opportunity to grow in an environment that perfectly aligns with my professional aspirations.  </p>
